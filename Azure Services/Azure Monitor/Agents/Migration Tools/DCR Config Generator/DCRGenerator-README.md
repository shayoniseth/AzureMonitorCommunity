# Workspace Config to DCR: Migration Tool

## Overview 
1. The purpose of this script is to help users convert their Log Analytics agent configuration stored in workspaces to corresponding Data Collection Rules (DCR) configuration.
2. The script will take workspace info as input and produce two separate ARM templates (along with parameter files) 
to cover both Windows and Linux performance counters, Windows event logs and Linux syslog. *Note:* Additional configuration for Azure solutions or services (VM Insights, Sentinel, Defender for Servers) are not yet supported, and maybe available in future versions.
3. The intended use of the script for migration is to generate the corresponding DCR ARM templates, which must then be associated (via built-in policy) to machines running the Azure Monitor Agent. 
so users can use that for programmatic deployment of their new DCRs.


## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get started with running the Migration Tool script.

### Prerequisites/Setup

- Powershell version 7.1.3 or higher is recommended (minimum version 5.1)
- Primarily uses Az Powershell module to pull workspace agent configuration information
- User will need Read access for the specified workspace resource
- `Connect-AzAccount` and `Select-AzSubscription` will be used to set the context for the script to run so proper Azure credentials will be needed

## Running the application

- Inputs for the Migration Tool Script
	- There are 6 parameters for the script with 5 being required

	| Parameter Name          | Description                                                                             |
	|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
	| *SubscriptionId*        | Subscription Id that contains the target workspace                                      |
	| *ResourceGroupName*     | Resource Group that contains the target workspace                                       |
	| *WorkspaceName*         | Name of the target workspace                                                            |
	| *DCRName*               | Name of the new DCR to create                                                           |
	| *Location*              | Region location for the new DCR.                                                        |
	| *FolderPath (Optional)* | Local path to store the output.  Current directory will be used if nothing is provided. |
	
- Instructions to Run the Script
	- Running the script is straightforward.  Use the script location along with at least the 5 required parameters.
	- Option #1:
		```PowerShell
		.\WorkspaceConfigToDCRMigrationTool.ps1 -SubscriptionId $subId -ResourceGroupName $rgName -WorkspaceName $workspaceName -DCRName $dcrName -Location $location -FolderPath $folderPath
		```
	- Option #2 (if you are just looking for the DCR payload json):
		```PowerShell
		$dcrJson = Get-DCRJson -ResourceGroupName $rgName -WorkspaceName $workspaceName -PlatformType $platformType
		$dcrJson | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10 | Out-File "C:\One\OutputFiles\dcr_output.json"
		```
- Output for the Script
	- There are two separate ARM templates that can be produced (based on agent configuration of the target workspace):
		- Windows ARM Template and Parameter Files: will be created if target workspace contains Windows Performance Counters and/or Windows Events
		- Linux ARM Template and Parameter Files: will be created if target workspace contains Linux Performance Counters and/or Linux Syslog Events
